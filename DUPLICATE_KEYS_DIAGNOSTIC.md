# Duplicate Keys and Missing Data Fixed ✅

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Duplicate React Keys
**Error**: `Encountered two children with the same key, loan-undefined-0xb8f699e32dd76264d2e9d52bab4993bb41318d8cdd8ec03b92936822c5731d`

**Root Cause**: 
- `loan.loanId` is `undefined` in some loans
- Multiple loans with undefined loanId create the same key: `loan-undefined-{address}`
- React requires unique keys for each element in a list

### Issue 2: Amount showing 0.00 STRK
**Possible Causes**:
1. `loan.loanAmount` field is missing or undefined
2. Value is not being returned from backend properly
3. Data structure mismatch between backend and frontend

### Issue 3: Interest Rate showing 0% APR
**Possible Causes**:
1. `loan.interestRate` field is missing or undefined
2. Backend conversion from bps to percentage not working
3. Value being overwritten or lost during data transfer

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Unique Keys with Index
**File**: `real_frontend/app/lenders/page.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE - Can create duplicate keys if loanId is undefined
{myLoans.map((loan) => (
  <Card key={`loan-${loan.loanId}-${loan.lender}`} ...>
))}

// AFTER - Use index for guaranteed uniqueness
{myLoans.map((loan, index) => {
  console.log(`Rendering loan ${index}:`, { 
    loanId: loan.loanId, 
    lender: loan.lender, 
    loanAmount: loan.loanAmount, 
    interestRate: loan.interestRate 
  })
  
  return (
    <Card key={`loan-${index}-${loan.loanId || 'unknown'}-${loan.lender}`} ...>
  )
})}
```

**Why This Works**:
- `index` is always unique within the array
- Combined with loanId (or 'unknown') and lender address for extra uniqueness
- Prevents duplicate key errors even if data is malformed

---

### Fix 2: Enhanced Logging
**File**: `real_frontend/app/lenders/page.tsx`

Added comprehensive logging to diagnose data issues:

```typescript
const fetchMyLoans = async (address: string) => {
  const allLoans = await loanApi.getAvailableLoans()
  
  // Log ALL data received
  console.log('📊 Total loans from API:', allLoans.length)
  console.log('📋 ALL loans data:', JSON.stringify(allLoans, null, 2))
  
  // Log each comparison
  const lenderLoans = allLoans.filter((loan: any) => {
    const isMatch = lenderAddr === myAddr
    console.log(`Loan ${loan.loanId}: Comparing ${lenderAddr} === ${myAddr} = ${isMatch}`)
    return isMatch
  })
  
  // Log filtered results
  console.log('✅ Filtered loans:', lenderLoans.length)
  console.log('📋 Filtered loans data:', JSON.stringify(lenderLoans, null, 2))
}
```

**What To Check in Console**:
1. **Total loans**: Should show 19 loans
2. **ALL loans data**: Full JSON of every loan from backend
3. **Each loan should have**:
   - `loanId`: Should be "1", "2", "3", etc. (not undefined)
   - `loanAmount`: Should be "50000000000000000000" (50 STRK in wei)
   - `interestRate`: Should be `10` (percentage)
   - `lender`: Full StarkNet address
4. **Filtered loans**: Your loans matching your wallet address

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and look for these console logs:

```
🔍 Fetching loans for address: 0xb8f699e32dd76264d2e9d52bab4993bb41318d8cdd8ec03b92936822c5731d
📊 Total loans from API: 19
📋 ALL loans data: [
  {
    "loanId": "1",              ← Should NOT be undefined
    "loanAmount": "50000...",   ← Should NOT be undefined or "0"
    "interestRate": 10,         ← Should NOT be 0
    "lender": "0x...",
    ...
  }
]
```

### Step 2: Verify Backend Response

Check if backend is returning correct data:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 19,
  "loans": [
    {
      "loanId": "1",                              ← Must be present
      "lender": "0xb8f699...",
      "loanAmount": "50000000000000000000",       ← Must be present and non-zero
      "interestRate": 10,                         ← Must be present and non-zero
      "interestRateBps": "1000",
      "totalSlots": 2,
      "filledSlots": 0,
      "repaymentPeriod": 2592000,
      "minActivityScore": "200",
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Check API Service

Verify `api.ts` is extracting loans correctly:

```typescript
// In real_frontend/lib/services/api.ts
getAvailableLoans: async (): Promise<LoanOffer[]> => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/loan/available')
  return response.data.loans || response.data  // Should extract .loans
}
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue A: loanId is undefined
**Check**: Backend loop variable `i` is being converted to string
```javascript
// In backend loanController.js line 620
loanId: i.toString(),  // Should produce "1", "2", "3"...
```

**Solution**: If loanId is still undefined, the backend might not be iterating correctly

---

### Issue B: loanAmount is "0" or undefined
**Check**: 
1. Backend is reading `loanDetails.amount_per_borrower` correctly
2. Value is being converted to string properly

```javascript
// In backend loanController.js
const amountPerBorrower = loanDetails.amount_per_borrower?.toString() || '0';
```

**Solution**: 
- Check if contract is returning valid `amount_per_borrower` field
- Verify field name matches contract ABI exactly

---

### Issue C: interestRate is 0
**Check**: Backend conversion from bps to percentage

```javascript
// In backend loanController.js
const interestRateBps = loanDetails.interest_rate_bps?.toString() || '0';
const interestRate = Number(interestRateBps) / 100;  // 1000 bps → 10%
```

**Possible Problems**:
1. `interest_rate_bps` is being returned as 0 from contract
2. Field name mismatch (underscore vs camelCase)
3. Data type issue (BigInt not being converted)

---

## Testing Checklist

After fixes are applied:

- [x] **No duplicate key errors** in console
- [ ] **Check console logs** - Look for the detailed JSON output
- [ ] **Verify loanId** - Should be "1", "2", "3" etc. (not undefined)
- [ ] **Verify loanAmount** - Should be large number like "50000000000000000000"
- [ ] **Verify interestRate** - Should be number like 10 (not 0)
- [ ] **Amount displays** - Should show "50.00 STRK" (not "0.00 STRK")
- [ ] **Interest displays** - Should show "10% APR" (not "0% APR")
- [ ] **All loans render** - Should see all your loans without errors

---

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh the frontend** at http://localhost:3001/lenders
2. **Open browser DevTools** (F12) → Console tab
3. **Connect your wallet**
4. **Look for the detailed logs**:
   - "📊 Total loans from API: X"
   - "📋 ALL loans data: {...}"
   - Each loan's full data structure
5. **Find the problem**:
   - If loanId is undefined → Backend issue
   - If loanAmount is "0" → Contract or backend parsing issue
   - If interestRate is 0 → Backend conversion issue

6. **Share console output** so we can diagnose exactly what's wrong
