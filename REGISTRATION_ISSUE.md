# ðŸ”§ Alternative: Skip On-Chain Registration

## Problem

The wallet is showing "Failed to load transaction details" when trying to register the proof. This could be:
1. Network connectivity issues
2. Contract not properly deployed
3. Wallet simulation failing

## Solution: Modified Flow

Instead of registering proofs separately, we can **submit the proof data directly when applying for the loan**.

### New Flow:
```
1. Generate ZK Proof (backend) âœ…
2. Store proof data locally âœ…
3. Apply for loan â†’ Pass proof data directly âœ…
4. Contract stores and verifies âœ…
```

### Benefits:
- âœ… One transaction instead of two
- âœ… Simpler UX
- âœ… No separate registration step
- âœ… Still cryptographically verified

## Quick Fix: Test Without Registration

Let me show you how to test if the issue is with the registration or something else.

### Option 1: Click "Confirm" Anyway

The "Transaction not executed" message is normal - it's just a preview. Try clicking **Confirm** and see if it goes through.

### Option 2: Check Contract Deployment

Verify the ActivityVerifier contract is deployed:
```

```

Should show contract details.

### Option 3: Use Simplified Flow

I can modify the code to skip registration and just apply directly with the proof data.

## Which Approach?

**Tell me:**
1. Did you try clicking "Confirm" in the wallet?
2. Do you want to try the simplified flow (skip registration)?
3. Should I check if the contract address is correct?
