# ‚úÖ Lender View Fix - Repayment Status Update

## Issue
After borrower repays a loan, the lender's view still shows "Approved" status instead of "Repaid".

## Root Cause
The lender's applications view was not auto-refreshing to get the latest status from the blockchain.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Manual Refresh Button
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/LoanLenderFlow.jsx`

Added a "üîÑ Refresh from Blockchain" button that:
- Fetches latest application status from the contract
- Updates the UI immediately
- Shows current count of Pending/Approved/Repaid loans

**Location:** Above the status filter tabs in the Applications section

### 2. How It Works

When lender clicks "üîÑ Refresh from Blockchain":
1. Frontend calls: `GET /api/loan/:loanId/applications`
2. Backend queries contract for each known commitment
3. Reads application status from contract:
   - `status = 0` ‚Üí "pending"
   - `status = 1` ‚Üí "approved"
   - `status = 2` ‚Üí "repaid"
4. Returns updated list to frontend
5. UI shows loan in correct tab (Pending/Approved/Repaid)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Create and Approve a Loan
1. **As Lender:** Create loan (password: 12345678)
2. **As Borrower:** Apply for loan
3. **As Lender:** Approve application
4. **Verify:** Application shows in "‚úÖ Approved" tab

### Step 2: Borrower Repays
1. **As Borrower:** Click "üí∞ Repay Loan"
2. **Approve STRK spending**
3. **Confirm repayment transaction**
4. **Wait for transaction confirmation**

### Step 3: Lender Refreshes
1. **As Lender:** Go to "My Loan Offers"
2. **Click:** "üëÄ View Applications"
3. **Click:** "üîÑ Refresh from Blockchain" button
4. **Verify:** Application now shows in "üí∞ Repaid" tab

## Expected Behavior

### Before Refresh
```
‚úÖ Approved (1)
  - Commitment: 0x2208...dd2d
  - Status: APPROVED
  - Deadline: ...
```

### After Refresh
```
üí∞ Repaid (1)
  - Commitment: 0x2208...dd2d
  - Status: REPAID
  - Repaid At: 2025-10-14 ...
```

## Auto-Refresh Option (Future Enhancement)

To automatically refresh every 30 seconds:

```javascript
// In LoanLenderFlow.jsx

useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedLoan) return;
  
  // Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('üîÑ Auto-refreshing applications...');
    loadApplications(selectedLoan);
  }, 30000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [selectedLoan]);
```

Add this to the component to enable automatic refreshing when viewing applications.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Manual refresh button added
‚úÖ **Working:** Backend reads latest status from contract
‚úÖ **Working:** Status mapping (0/1/2 ‚Üí pending/approved/repaid)
‚úÖ **Working:** UI shows correct tab based on status

‚è≥ **Optional:** Auto-refresh every 30 seconds (not yet implemented)

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/pages/LoanLenderFlow.jsx`
   - Added refresh button UI
   - Button calls existing `loadApplications()` function
   
2. `backend/src/routes/loanRoutes_onchain.js`
   - Already reading latest status from contract
   - No changes needed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Refresh button doesn't update status
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend is running
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify contract address is correct in .env
4. Check browser console for API errors

### Issue: Status stuck on "Approved" even after refresh
**Possible Causes:**
1. Repayment transaction failed (check Starkscan)
2. Wrong commitment used for repayment
3. Contract not updated (check on-chain status)

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/loan/1/applications');
const data = await response.json();
console.log('Applications:', data.applications);
// Check status field for each application
```

### Issue: Application disappears after repayment
**This is EXPECTED behavior** if using status filters:
- Repaid loans only show in "üí∞ Repaid" tab
- Switch to "üìã All" tab to see all applications
