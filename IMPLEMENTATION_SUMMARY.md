## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
**Expected**: Server runs on http://localhost:3000

### 2. Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected**: Vite runs on http://localhost:3001

### 3. Create Test Loan (via API):
```bash
# PowerShell
$body = @{
  lenderAddress = "0x123...abc"
  lenderName = "DeFi Lender Alpha"
  amount = "50"
  interestRate = "5"
  repaymentPeriod = "600"
  totalSlots = 2
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/loan/test/create-loan" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

### 4. Test Lender Portal:
1. Visit: http://localhost:3001/loan-lender
2. Enter password: `12345678`
3. Connect wallet
4. Generate ZK proof
5. Create real loan (requires STRK balance)

### 5. Test Borrower Portal:
1. Visit: http://localhost:3001/loan-borrower
2. Connect wallet (different from lender)
3. Generate ZK proof
4. Apply for loan
5. Check application status

### 6. View Cache Status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/loan/cache/stats
```

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ In-memory cache (data resets on server restart)
- ✅ No blockchain event listening yet
- ✅ Smart contracts need multi-borrower functions
- ✅ Test loans don't interact with contracts

### TODO:
1. **Event Listening**: Listen to contract events for loan creation/approval
2. **Contract Updates**: Add `create_multi_loan()` and `approve_borrower()` to Cairo contracts
3. **Persistent Storage**: Replace cache with event-based data fetching
4. **Transaction Broadcasting**: Integrate actual contract calls

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production):
1. ✅ Update Cairo smart contracts:
   - Add `create_multi_loan(amount, borrower_count, interest, period, commitment)`
   - Add `approve_borrower(loan_id, borrower_commitment)`
   - Add `get_loan_applications(loan_id)`

2. ✅ Implement event listener:
   - Listen to `LoanCreated` events
   - Listen to `ApplicationSubmitted` events
   - Listen to `BorrowerApproved` events
   - Update cache from events

3. ✅ Fix contract interaction:
   - Connect lender flow to actual contract calls
   - Test approval flow with real STRK transfers
   - Verify escrow mechanics

### Optional Enhancements:
- [ ] Loan categories/filters
- [ ] Credit score visualization
- [ ] Lender reputation system
- [ ] Automated matching algorithm
- [ ] Email/push notifications
- [ ] Multi-language support
