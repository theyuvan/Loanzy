## Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

You'll see these errors in the console - **they are NOT critical**:

```
error: Failed to get StarkNet block number
error: Failed to get current block
error: Failed to get starting block
```

**Why:** The event watcher is trying to connect to StarkNet for real-time event monitoring, but it's having connectivity issues. This doesn't affect the main API functionality.

**Impact:** None on core features. The API endpoints will still work perfectly.

## Testing the Backend

### **Test 1: Check if backend is running**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/api/loan/test-version
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "version": "v2.0-with-blockchain-query",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T..."
}
```

### **Test 2: Get available loans**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 1,
  "loans": [...]
}
```

### **Test 3: Get loans by lender**

## Frontend Integration

Your **real frontend** at http://localhost:3001 is configured to use this backend:

### **API Configuration:**
File: `real_frontend/lib/services/api.ts`
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api'
```

### **What Works Now:**

1. **Lender Page** (http://localhost:3001/lenders):
   - ‚úÖ Create loan offers ‚Üí Writes to blockchain
   - ‚úÖ View "My Loans" ‚Üí Reads from blockchain via backend
   - ‚úÖ View statistics ‚Üí Fetches from backend

2. **Borrower Page** (http://localhost:3001/borrowers):
   - ‚úÖ View available loans ‚Üí Reads from blockchain via backend
   - ‚úÖ Apply for loans ‚Üí Writes to blockchain
   - ‚úÖ Wallet analysis ‚Üí Backend analyzes transactions

---

## What to Do Now

### **1. Refresh Your Frontend:**
Go to http://localhost:3001/lenders and refresh the page.

### **2. Check Your Loan:**
The loan you just created (TX: `0x184ae834dde97f6e7095db8a5cee0b18d98545e9f1c10d4652a22c845672ff5`) should now appear in:
- "My Loans" section on lender page
- "Available Loans" on borrower page

### **3. Test the Flow:**

**As Lender:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/lenders
2. Should see your loan with:
   - Amount: 50 STRK per borrower
   - Slots: 2 total, 0 filled
   - Interest: 0% (you set it to 0)
   - Status: Active

**As Borrower:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/borrowers
2. Should see the same loan in available loans
3. Apply for it!

## Troubleshooting

### **Issue:** "Failed to load resource: 500 error"
**Solution:** Backend might not be running. Check terminal.

### **Issue:** "Connection refused"
**Solution:** Backend is not running. Start it with `npm start`.

### **Issue:** "No loans showing"
**Solution:** 
1. Wait 10-20 seconds for blockchain indexing
2. Click "Refresh" button in UI
3. Check StarkScan to verify transaction was confirmed

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
