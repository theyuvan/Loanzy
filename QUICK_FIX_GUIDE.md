## Fastest Solution: Get Testnet ETH

### Step 1: Get Ethereum Sepolia ETH (Free)

Visit these faucets (try all for more ETH):

1. **Alchemy Faucet** (Easiest - requires email)
   - URL: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
   - Amount: 0.5 ETH per day
   - Login with Google/Email

2. **Sepolia PoW Faucet** (No login needed)
   - URL: https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/
   - Mine some testnet ETH by running proof-of-work in browser
   - Can get 0.05-0.5 ETH

3. **QuickNode Faucet**
   - URL: https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia
   - Amount: 0.1 ETH
   - Requires social login

**Target:** Get at least 0.5 ETH on Ethereum Sepolia

### Step 2: Bridge to Starknet Sepolia

1. **Visit Starknet Bridge:**
   - URL: https://sepolia.starkgate.starknet.io/

2. **Connect Wallets:**
   - Connect your MetaMask (Ethereum Sepolia)
   - Connect your Argent X (Starknet Sepolia - your address)

3. **Bridge ETH:**
   - Bridge 0.3-0.4 ETH from Ethereum to Starknet
   - Keep some ETH on Ethereum for gas fees
   - Wait ~10-20 minutes for bridge to complete

### Step 3: Make Test Transactions

Once you have ETH on Starknet Sepolia:

**Option A: Send to yourself (Easiest)**
```
1. Open Argent X wallet
2. Click "Send"
3. Enter your own address: 0x05B3cf7557800CcE10fbAD48E6cc95F2Ffd82702996eA324bBB2470B6A6Ba7ef
4. Amount: 0.001 ETH
5. Repeat 50+ times (yes, really!)
```

**Option B: Use a script (Faster)**
I can help you create a simple script to make multiple transactions automatically.

**Target:** Get to **50+ transactions** total (you have 3, need 47 more)

### Step 4: Verify New Score

After making transactions, your score will be:

**With 50 transactions + 0.3 ETH:**
- Balance Score: 0.3 √ó 100 = **30**
- Transaction Score: 50 √ó 5 = **250**
- Consistency Score: **200** (50 > 10)
- **Total: 480 points** (close!)

**With 60 transactions + 0.3 ETH:**
- Balance Score: **30**
- Transaction Score: 60 √ó 5 = **300**
- Consistency Score: **200**
- **Total: 530 points** ‚úÖ **PASSES!**

## Alternative: Lower Threshold for Testing

If you just want to test the app quickly:

### Edit Frontend Threshold

**File:** `frontend/src/components/ZKProofGenerator.jsx`

**Line 7:** Change from:
```javascript
const [threshold] = useState(500);
```

To:
```javascript
const [threshold] = useState(50); // Lowered for testing
```

**Your score (65) will now pass the threshold!**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember:** This is for testing only. The real application needs proper activity thresholds.

### Edit Backend Threshold (optional)

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/proofController.js`

The backend will also validate, so you might want to update there too if needed.

## Recommended Path

For a **realistic test of the full system**, I recommend:

1. ‚úÖ Get testnet ETH (30 mins)
2. ‚úÖ Bridge to Starknet (20 mins)
3. ‚úÖ Make 50-60 transactions (1 hour with manual sending, or 5 mins with script)
4. ‚úÖ Test the full application workflow

This will give you:
- Real understanding of the scoring system
- Proper test of wallet analysis
- Valid ZK proof generation
- Complete loan request flow
