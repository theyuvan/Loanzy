# Quick Testing Guide - Identity Commitment System

## Prerequisites
- Backend running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend running on `http://localhost:5173`
- Wallet connected with STRK tokens

## Test Scenario: Complete Flow

### Part 1: First-Time Borrower (Identity Creation)

1. **Open Borrower Page**: Navigate to borrower flow
2. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet"
3. **Fetch Activity**: Click "Fetch Activity Data"
   - Should show activity score (e.g., 750)
4. **Generate ZK Proof**: Click "Generate ZK Proof"
   - Check browser console for: `üíæ Saved NEW identity commitment: 0x...`
   - Check localStorage: `identityCommitment` should be saved
   - Transaction should be submitted to ActivityVerifier contract
5. **Check Proof Status**: After transaction confirmation
   - `zkProofGenerated` should be true
   - Available loans should load

### Part 2: Apply for First Loan

6. **Select Loan**: Click "View Details" on any loan
7. **Apply for Loan**: Click "Apply for this Loan"
   - Check console for: `üéØ Identity commitment (for applications): 0x...`
   - Transaction should be submitted to LoanEscrowZK contract
   - Alert: "Application submitted successfully!"

### Part 3: Score Update (Same Identity)

8. **Clear zkProofGenerated** (simulate score update):
   - Open browser DevTools
   - Run: `localStorage.removeItem('zkCommitment')`
   - Refresh page, connect wallet again
9. **Modify Activity Score** (for testing):
   - In console: `activityData.score = 850` (or fetch new activity)
10. **Generate New ZK Proof**: Click "Generate ZK Proof" again
    - Check console for: `‚úÖ Found existing identity commitment: 0x...`
    - Should see: "Using same identity as before"
    - New proof commitment may differ, but identityCommitment stays same
11. **Apply for Second Loan**: Apply to a different loan
    - Uses SAME identity commitment
    - New application stored with same commitment

### Part 4: Lender View (Critical Test)

12. **Open Lender Page**: Navigate to lender flow
13. **Login**: Enter password (12345678)
14. **Connect Wallet**: Connect as lender
15. **View Your Loans**: Click "View Applications" on your loan
16. **Check Applications**: Should see ALL applications
    - Check console for: `üìä Total events found: X`
    - Should see: `‚úÖ Found application for loan Y!`
    - Applications list should populate with borrower details

### Expected Results

‚úÖ **Identity Persistence**:
- localStorage has `identityCommitment` saved
- All applications use same commitment value
- Can verify in blockchain events: all have same commitment

‚úÖ **Score Updates Work**:
- New proofs can be generated with updated scores
- Identity commitment remains unchanged
- Both proofs registered on ActivityVerifier

‚úÖ **Lender Can See Applications**:
- Backend queries LoanApplicationSubmitted events
- Finds all commitments that applied to loan
- Fetches full application details for each
- Returns array with borrower address, score, status

## Testing Commands

### Check Backend Logs
```powershell
# Watch backend logs for debugging
cd c:\zk-affordability-loan\backend
npm start
```

Look for these log messages:
- `üîê Identity system` - Shows if existing identity found
- `üì¨ Fetching applications for loan: X` - Lender querying apps
- `üìä Total events found: Y` - Event query results
- `‚úÖ Found application for loan X!` - Application discovered

### Check localStorage
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Identity:', localStorage.getItem('identityCommitment'));
console.log('Proof Hash:', localStorage.getItem('zkProofHash'));
console.log('Score:', localStorage.getItem('zkActivityScore'));
```

### Test API Endpoints Directly

```powershell
# Generate proof (first time)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/proof/generate" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} `
  -Body '{"salary": 750, "threshold": 100, "walletAddress": "0x0239..."}' `
  | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | ConvertFrom-Json

# Generate proof (with existing identity)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/proof/generate" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} `
  -Body '{"salary": 850, "threshold": 100, "walletAddress": "0x0239...", "identityCommitment": "0x5b5a..."}' `
  | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | ConvertFrom-Json

# Get applications for loan
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/loan/33/applications" `
  | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | ConvertFrom-Json
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No applications found"
**Cause**: Event querying might be slow or failing on Sepolia
**Solution**: 
- Check backend logs for event query errors
- Wait a few seconds and refresh
- Verify applications exist: check borrower endpoint `/borrower/:commitment/applications`

### Issue: "Different commitment each time"
**Cause**: localStorage not persisting or being cleared
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for `üíæ Saved NEW identity commitment`
- Verify localStorage has `identityCommitment` key
- Make sure not clearing localStorage between tests

### Issue: "Transaction failed"
**Cause**: Insufficient STRK balance or wallet not connected
**Solution**:
- Check STRK balance in wallet
- Ensure wallet is connected and on Sepolia testnet
- Check transaction error in console

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Identity commitment saved on first proof generation
‚úÖ Same commitment used for all applications (check localStorage)
‚úÖ Score can be updated without losing identity
‚úÖ Lender can see ALL applications for their loan
‚úÖ Applications show correct borrower address and score
‚úÖ Backend logs show event querying working
‚úÖ No errors in browser console or backend logs

## Next Steps After Testing

Once identity system is verified working:
1. Test approval flow (lender approves borrower)
2. Test repayment flow (borrower repays loan)
3. Test escrow/transfer mechanics
4. Consider implementing event indexer for production
