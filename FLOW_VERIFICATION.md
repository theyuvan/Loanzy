# ZK Loan System - Complete Flow Verification

## üéØ Overview
This document verifies the complete end-to-end flow of the ZK-based lending system, including STRK token transfers, ZK proof verification, and identity reveal mechanisms.

---

## üìã Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED & WORKING**

#### 1. **Loan Creation (Lender Side)** - ON-CHAIN ‚úì
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/LoanLenderFlow.jsx` (lines 132-280)

**Flow:**
1. Lender fills form with:
   - Amount per borrower (e.g., 50 STRK)
   - Number of borrowers/slots
   - Interest rate (in bps, e.g., 500 = 5%)
   - Repayment period (in seconds)

2. **STRK Token Approval:**
   - Total amount = `amount_per_borrower √ó total_slots`
   - Calls `STRK.approve(LOAN_ESCROW_ADDRESS, total_amount)`
   - Transaction fee: ~0.0027 STRK (network fee)
   - Waits for approval confirmation

3. **Create Loan Offer:**
   - Calls `LoanEscrowZK.create_loan_offer(...)`
   - Transaction fee: ~0.004 STRK (network fee)
   - Contract stores loan details on-chain
   - Emits `LoanOfferCreated` event

**Gas Fees:**
- Approval tx: ~0.0027 STRK
- Create loan tx: ~0.004 STRK
- **Total: ~0.0067 STRK** (gas fees only, loan amount is approved not transferred yet)

**Smart Contract:** `contracts/starknet/src/loan_escrow_zk.cairo` (lines 227-282)
```cairo
fn create_loan_offer(
    ref self: ContractState,
    amount_per_borrower: u256,
    total_slots: u8,
    interest_rate_bps: u256,
    repayment_period: u64,
    min_activity_score: u256,
) -> u256
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY ON-CHAIN** - No mock data

---

#### 2. **Loan Fetching & Display** - ON-CHAIN ‚úì
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/loanRoutes_onchain.js`

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/loan/lender/:address` - Fetch lender's loans (lines 185-295)
- `GET /api/loan/available` - Fetch available loans for borrowers (lines 108-182)
- `GET /api/loan/borrower/:commitment/applications` - Fetch borrower's applications (lines 334-419)
- `GET /api/loan/borrower/:commitment/active` - Fetch active loans (lines 421-502)

**How it works:**
1. Calls `provider.callContract()` with u256 parameters as `[low, high]`
2. Queries `get_loan_count()` to get total loans
3. Iterates through all loans and calls `get_loan_details(loan_id)`
4. Parses raw felt arrays into structured loan objects
5. Filters by lender address or status

**Current Output:**
```
‚úÖ Found 28 available loans
‚úÖ Found 20 loans for lender
‚úÖ Found 0 active loans (no approved loans yet)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY ON-CHAIN** - All data fetched from blockchain

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

#### 3. **ZK Proof Generation** - OFF-CHAIN ‚úì
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/LoanBorrowerFlow.jsx`

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ ZK circuit exists: `contracts/zk/activityVerifier.circom`
- ‚úÖ Proof generation logic exists
- ‚úÖ Cached proof mechanism exists
- ‚ùì **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Check if proof is actually being generated when borrower applies

**What it does:**
```circom
// Proves: activity_score >= threshold
// Without revealing: actual activity_score, wallet_address, salt
// Output: commitment = Poseidon(activity_score, wallet_address, salt)
```

**Next Step:** Test borrower application flow and check browser console for proof generation

---

#### 4. **Loan Application (Borrower Side)** - NEEDS ON-CHAIN VERIFICATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Location:** Frontend TBD

**Smart Contract Function:** `contracts/starknet/src/loan_escrow_zk.cairo` (lines 284-337)
```cairo
fn apply_for_loan(
    ref self: ContractState,
    loan_id: u256,
    proof_hash: felt252,
    commitment: felt252,
)
```

**Critical Implementation:**
```cairo
// **ENFORCES ZK PROOF VERIFICATION ON-CHAIN**
let verifier = IActivityVerifierDispatcher {
    contract_address: self.activity_verifier.read()
};

let proof_valid = verifier.verify_proof(
    proof_hash,
    commitment,
    loan.min_activity_score
);

assert(proof_valid, 'ZK proof verification failed');
```

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONTRACT READY** - Frontend integration needs verification

**Missing:**
- Frontend endpoint to call `apply_for_loan()`
- Need to check if ZK proof is submitted correctly
- Verify `ActivityVerifier` contract is deployed and working

---

#### 5. **Loan Approval & Fund Transfer** - ON-CHAIN ‚úì (Contract Ready)
**Location:** `contracts/starknet/src/loan_escrow_zk.cairo` (lines 339-399)

```cairo
fn approve_borrower(
    ref self: ContractState,
    loan_id: u256,
    borrower_commitment: felt252,
)
```

**Flow:**
1. Lender calls `approve_borrower(loan_id, borrower_commitment)`
2. Contract validates:
   - Caller is the lender
   - Loan is active
   - Application is pending
   - Slots available
3. **TRANSFERS STRK TOKENS:**
   ```cairo
   let strk_token = IERC20Dispatcher { contract_address: self.strk_token.read() };
   let success = strk_token.transfer_from(
       caller,  // lender
       app.borrower,  // borrower
       loan.amount_per_borrower
   );
   assert(success, 'STRK transfer failed');
   ```
4. Sets repayment deadline: `timestamp + repayment_period`
5. Updates loan status
6. Emits `BorrowerApproved` event

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY ON-CHAIN** - But needs frontend integration

**Missing:**
- Frontend UI for lender to approve applications
- Check `frontend/src/pages/LoanLenderFlow.jsx` for approval flow

---

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

#### 6. **Loan Repayment** - PARTIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Contract Status:** Placeholder only
```cairo
fn repay_loan(ref self: ContractState, loan_id: u256) {
    assert(false, 'Use repay_loan_with_commitment');
}
```

**What's Needed:**
1. Add `commitment` parameter to identify borrower
2. Calculate repayment amount: `amount + interest`
3. Transfer STRK from borrower to lender
4. Update application status to `repaid`
5. Check if within deadline

**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT FUNCTIONAL** - Needs implementation

---

#### 7. **Identity Reveal Mechanism** - NOT IMPLEMENTED ‚ùå
**Purpose:** If borrower doesn't repay within deadline, reveal their identity

**What's Needed:**
1. Add function to check if deadline passed:
   ```cairo
   fn is_repayment_overdue(loan_id: u256, commitment: felt252) -> bool {
       let app = self.applications.read((loan_id, commitment));
       get_block_timestamp() > app.repayment_deadline && app.status == 1
   }
   ```

2. Add reveal function:
   ```cairo
   fn reveal_borrower_identity(loan_id: u256, commitment: felt252) -> ContractAddress {
       let caller = get_caller_address();
       let loan = self.loan_offers.read(loan_id);
       let app = self.applications.read((loan_id, commitment));
       
       assert(caller == loan.lender, 'Only lender can reveal');
       assert(is_repayment_overdue(loan_id, commitment), 'Not overdue yet');
       
       app.borrower  // Return borrower's wallet address
   }
   ```

3. Frontend integration to display revealed identity

**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

## üîß Action Items

### Priority 1: Critical Missing Features

1. **Verify ZK Proof Flow:**
   ```bash
   # Test borrower application
   # Check browser console for:
   # - "Generating ZK proof..."
   # - "Proof generated: { proof: [...], publicSignals: [...] }"
   # - "Calling apply_for_loan with proof_hash..."
   ```

2. **Check ActivityVerifier Contract:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify it's deployed and address is correct
   const ACTIVITY_VERIFIER_ADDRESS = '0x071b94eb84b81868b61fb0ec1bbb59df47bb508583bc79325e5fa997ee3eb4be';
   ```

3. **Test Frontend Approval Flow:**
   - Check if `frontend/src/pages/LoanLenderFlow.jsx` has approve button
   - Verify it calls contract's `approve_borrower()`
   - Confirm STRK transfer happens on approval

### Priority 2: Implement Missing Features

4. **Fix Loan Repayment:**
   ```cairo
   fn repay_loan_with_commitment(
       ref self: ContractState,
       loan_id: u256,
       commitment: felt252
   ) {
       let caller = get_caller_address();
       let loan = self.loan_offers.read(loan_id);
       let mut app = self.applications.read((loan_id, commitment));
       
       assert(app.borrower == caller, 'Not your loan');
       assert(app.status == 1, 'Loan not approved');
       
       // Calculate repayment
       let interest = (loan.amount_per_borrower * loan.interest_rate_bps) / 10000;
       let repayment_amount = loan.amount_per_borrower + interest;
       
       // Transfer STRK from borrower to lender
       let strk_token = IERC20Dispatcher { contract_address: self.strk_token.read() };
       strk_token.transfer_from(caller, loan.lender, repayment_amount);
       
       // Update status
       app.status = 2;  // repaid
       app.repaid_at = get_block_timestamp();
       self.applications.write((loan_id, commitment), app);
       
       self.emit(LoanRepaid { ... });
   }
   ```

5. **Implement Identity Reveal:**
   - Add contract functions (see above)
   - Add frontend UI to show "OVERDUE" status
   - Add "Reveal Identity" button for lender
   - Display revealed wallet address

### Priority 3: Testing

6. **End-to-End Test:**
   ```
   Test 1: Successful Loan Flow
   1. Lender creates loan (50 STRK)
   2. Borrower applies with ZK proof
   3. Lender approves ‚Üí 50 STRK transferred
   4. Borrower repays within deadline ‚Üí Lender receives 50 + interest STRK
   5. Loan marked as repaid
   
   Test 2: Overdue Loan Flow
   1. Lender creates loan (repayment_period = 600 seconds = 10 minutes)
   2. Borrower applies and gets approved
   3. Wait 11 minutes (or fast-forward blockchain time)
   4. Lender calls reveal_identity()
   5. Borrower's wallet address displayed
   ```

## üîç Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check backend logs for loan fetching
# Should show: "‚úÖ Found X loans for lender"

# 2. Check frontend console when creating loan
# Should show: "‚úÖ Approval confirmed" ‚Üí "‚úÖ Loan offer created on blockchain!"

# 3. Check StarkScan for transactions
https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/[TRANSACTION_HASH]

# 4. Verify STRK balance changes
# Before loan creation: X STRK
# After approval tx: X - 0.0027 STRK
# After create tx: X - 0.0067 STRK
# After borrower approved: X - 50.0067 STRK (if 50 STRK loan)

# 5. Check contract state
# Use StarkScan to query get_loan_count()
# Verify loan details match what was created
```
