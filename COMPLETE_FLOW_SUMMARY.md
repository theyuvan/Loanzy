## üîÑ Complete Loan Creation Flow

### Step 1: Lender Creates Loan
1. **Frontend**: User fills form
   - Loan Amount: 50 STRK
   - Number of Borrowers: 1
   - Interest Rate: 5% (500 bps)
   - Repayment Period: 598 seconds

2. **Frontend**: Connects wallet
   ```javascript
   const starknet = await connect();
   ```

3. **Frontend**: Approve STRK spending
   ```javascript
   // Approve: 50 STRK √ó 1 slot = 50 STRK total
   const approveAmount = 50 * 1e18;
   await strkContract.invoke('approve', {
     spender: LOAN_ESCROW_ADDRESS,
     amount: uint256.bnToUint256(approveAmount)
   });
   ```

4. **Frontend**: Create loan on blockchain
   ```javascript
   await loanEscrowContract.invoke('create_loan_offer', {
     amount_per_borrower: uint256.bnToUint256(50 * 1e18),
     total_slots: "1",
     interest_rate_bps: uint256.bnToUint256(500),
     repayment_period: "598",
     min_activity_score: uint256.bnToUint256(100)
   });
   ```

5. **Smart Contract**: Stores loan on-chain
   - Increments loan counter (now 29)
   - Emits `LoanOfferCreated` event
   - Returns loan_id

6. **Frontend**: Reloads loan list
   ```javascript
   await loadMyLoans();  // Fetches from backend
   ```

7. **Backend**: Fetches all loans
   ```javascript
   // Loops through loan_id 1 to 29
   for (let i = 1; i <= loanCount; i++) {
     const { low, high } = uint256.bnToUint256(BigInt(i));
     const rawResult = await provider.callContract({
       entrypoint: 'get_loan_details',
       calldata: [low, high]
     });
     // Parse raw result into loan object
     // Filter by lender address
   }
   ```

8. **Frontend**: Displays loans with complete details
   - Amount per Borrower: 50.00 STRK
   - Slots: 0/1
   - Interest: 5.00%
   - Repayment Period: 9min
   - Min Score: 100
   - Created: 10/13/2025, 5:38:52 PM

## üéØ What Happens After Loan Creation

### Immediate Effects ‚úÖ
1. **Blockchain State Updated**
   - Loan #29 created and stored on-chain
   - Loan counter incremented from 28 to 29

   - Returns filtered list to frontend

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - Receives complete loan data from backend
   - Maps backend fields to UI components
   - Displays all loan details including:
     - STRK amount (converted from wei)
     - Interest rate (converted from bps)
     - Repayment period (converted to minutes)
     - Creation timestamp
     - Current status

## üöÄ Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Test Loan Creation
- [x] Create loan in lender page
- [x] Verify wallet prompts for STRK approval
- [x] Verify wallet prompts for loan creation
- [x] Check transaction on StarkScan
- [x] Verify loan appears in "My Loans"
- [x] Verify all details are correct

### 2. Test Borrower Application
- [ ] Switch to borrower page
- [ ] Generate ZK proof
- [ ] Apply for loan
- [ ] Verify application shows in lender's "Applications"

### 3. Test Loan Approval
- [ ] Lender clicks "View Applications"
- [ ] Lender approves borrower
- [ ] Verify STRK transfer from lender to borrower
- [ ] Check transaction on StarkScan
- [ ] Verify loan status updates to "funded"

### 4. Test Loan Repayment (When Implemented)
- [ ] Borrower repays loan with interest
- [ ] Verify STRK transfer from borrower to lender
- [ ] Verify loan status updates to "repaid"

---

## üìä Data Conversion Reference

### STRK Amounts (wei to STRK)
```javascript
// Backend returns: "50000000000000000000"
// Frontend displays: 50.00 STRK
const strk = parseFloat(amountPerBorrower) / 1e18;
```

### Interest Rate (bps to %)
```javascript
// Backend returns: "500"
// Frontend displays: 5.00%
const percent = parseFloat(interestRate) / 100;
```

### Repayment Period (seconds to minutes)
```javascript
// Backend returns: "598"
// Frontend displays: 9min
const minutes = Math.floor(repaymentPeriod / 60);
```

### Timestamp (ISO to Local)
```javascript
// Backend returns: "2025-10-13T09:38:52.000Z"
// Frontend displays: 10/13/2025, 5:38:52 PM
const local = new Date(createdAt).toLocaleString();
```

## üéâ Success Metrics

### What Should Work Now
1. ‚úÖ Create loan ‚Üí Wallet prompts ‚Üí Transaction confirmed ‚Üí Loan appears
2. ‚úÖ View loans ‚Üí All 29 loans fetched ‚Üí Complete details displayed
3. ‚úÖ Each loan shows: Amount, Slots, Interest, Period, Score, Date
4. ‚úÖ All data from blockchain (verify on StarkScan)

### What You Should See
```
Console Output:
üìã Loading my loans...
‚úÖ Loaded loans: 6
üì¶ Loan details: [{id: "29", amountPerBorrower: "50000000000000000000", ...}]

UI Output:
üìã My Loans (6)
- Loan #29: 50.00 STRK, 0/1 slots, 5.00%, 9min, Score 100 ‚úÖ
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Loans Not Showing
**Check:** Console logs for "‚úÖ Loaded loans: X"
**Fix:** Ensure backend returns `{loans: [...]}` not just `[...]`

### Issue: Wrong Amounts Displayed
**Check:** Is amount showing as huge number like "5e19"?
**Fix:** Convert wei to STRK: `parseFloat(amount) / 1e18`

### Issue: Interest Rate Wrong
**Check:** Is it showing 500 instead of 5%?
**Fix:** Convert bps to %: `parseFloat(rate) / 100`

### Issue: Wallet Not Prompting
**Check:** Console for "üîå Connecting to wallet..."
**Fix:** Ensure `await connect()` resolves before contract calls
