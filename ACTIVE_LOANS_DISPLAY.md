# ✅ Active Loans Display Feature - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved
After a lender approves your loan application, the approved loan was not visible in the borrower's frontend. You could apply for loans but couldn't see which loans had been approved and required repayment.

## 🚀 Solution Implemented

### Backend Endpoint (Already Existed)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/loan/borrower/:commitment/active`
- **Purpose**: Fetches all approved loans for a borrower using their ZK proof commitment
- **Returns**: List of active loans with details (amount, interest, deadline, etc.)

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **New State Variables**
```typescript
const [myActiveLoans, setMyActiveLoans] = useState<any[]>([])
const [isLoadingActiveLoans, setIsLoadingActiveLoans] = useState(false)
```

#### 2. **New Function: `fetchMyActiveLoans()`**
- Fetches active loans from backend using ZK proof commitment
- Automatically called after:
  - Generating ZK proof (Step 3)
  - Applying for a loan
  - Clicking "Refresh" in dashboard
- Logs detailed information for debugging

#### 3. **New UI Section: "My Active Loans"**
Added at the top of the dashboard (above "Available Loan Offers"):
- **Shows only when you have active loans** (conditional rendering)
- **Green theme** to distinguish from available loans
- **Displays**:
  - Loan ID and lender address
  - Received amount (what you got)
  - Total repayment amount (principal + interest)
  - Interest rate percentage
  - Approval date
  - Repayment deadline
  - Time remaining (days or hours)
- **Visual Warnings**:
  - Orange warning when deadline is approaching
  - Red urgent warning when < 1 day remaining
- **Repay Button**: Placeholder for future repayment functionality

#### 4. **New Component: `ActiveLoanCard`**
Beautiful card component with:
- ✅ Green gradient design (approved status)
- 💰 Loan amount display
- 💵 Repayment amount (with interest calculated)
- ⏰ Countdown timer showing days/hours left
- ⚠️ Urgent warning for near-deadline loans
- 🔘 Repay button (UI ready for implementation)

## 📋 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Step 1**: Analyze wallet activity → Score: 340 ✅
2. **Step 2**: Verify identity ✅
3. **Step 3**: Generate ZK proof ✅
   - After this, `fetchMyActiveLoans()` is called
4. **Dashboard**: 
   - **Top Section**: "My Active Loans" (if any approved)
   - **Bottom Section**: "Available Loan Offers" (to apply)

### After Lender Approves:
1. Lender approves your loan application on-chain
2. Loan status changes to "approved" (status = 1)
3. Borrower clicks "Refresh" or reopens dashboard
4. `fetchMyActiveLoans()` queries blockchain via backend
5. Backend finds approved loans matching your commitment
6. Active loan appears in green card at top of dashboard

## 🔧 Technical Details

## 📞 Support

### If Active Loans Don't Show:
1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Look for "💼 Fetching my active loans..."
   - Check if commitment is logged correctly
2. **Verify loan was approved by lender**
   - Check transaction on Voyager
   - Loan status should be "approved" (status = 1)
3. **Click Refresh button** in "My Active Loans" section
4. **Check backend logs** for API call details

### Common Issues:
- ❌ "No active loans showing" → Loan might still be pending approval
