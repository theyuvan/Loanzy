# 🔧 Active Loans Display Fix

## Problem Statement

After lender approves a loan and transfers STRK:
- ❌ Loan disappears from borrower's "My Applications"
- ❌ Loan does NOT appear in borrower's "Active Loans" section
- ❌ Borrower cannot see the approved loan to repay it

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend Response Format Mismatch
**File**: `backend/src/routes/loanRoutes_onchain.js` (line 795)

**Before**:
```javascript
res.json(activeLoans);  // Returns array directly
```

**Issue**: Frontend expects `response.data.loans` but backend was sending the array at `response.data` root level.

**Fixed**:
```javascript
res.json({ loans: activeLoans, count: activeLoans.length });
```

---

### 2. Missing Initial Load of Active Loans
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/LoanBorrowerFlowNew.jsx` (line 355)

**Before**:
```javascript
setZkProofGenerated(true);

// Load available loans
await loadAvailableLoans();
await loadMyApplications();
// ❌ Missing: loadMyActiveLoans()
```

**Issue**: After generating ZK proof, the app loads available loans and applications, but NOT active loans. So even if a loan was already approved, it wouldn't show until the 30-second auto-refresh.

**Fixed**:
```javascript
setZkProofGenerated(true);

// Load available loans, applications, and active loans
await loadAvailableLoans();
await loadMyApplications();
await loadMyActiveLoans();  // ✅ Added!
```

## How Active Loans Work

### Backend Endpoint
**Route**: `GET /api/loan/borrower/:commitment/active`

**Logic**:
1. Gets all loans on-chain (loan count)
2. For each loan, checks `get_application(loan_id, commitment)`
3. Filters for applications where:
   - `borrower !== '0x0'` (application exists)
   - `status === 1` (approved)
4. Returns loan details + application details

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "loans": [
    {
      "loanId": "38",
      "lender": "0x5b3cf7...",
      "amount": "1000000000000000000",
      "interestRate": "500",
      "borrower": "0x2398452...",
      "commitment": "0x22083c8b...",
      "status": "approved",
      "approvedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "repaymentDeadline": "2025-01-22T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: New Approval Flow

1. **Start Fresh**:
   - Stop all processes
   - Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Restart backend: `npm start` (in backend/)
   - Restart frontend: `npm run dev` (in frontend/)

2. **Borrower Setup**:
   - Open borrower page: http://localhost:5173/borrower
   - Connect wallet (Argent X)
   - Generate ZK proof
   - **Check console**: Should see "Loading my active loans..." after proof generation

3. **Apply for Loan**:
   - Find an available loan
   - Click "Apply Now"
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Loan should appear in "My Applications" (status: pending)

4. **Lender Approval**:
   - Open lender page in new tab: http://localhost:5173/lender
   - Password: 12345678
   - Connect lender wallet
   - Generate ZK proof
   - Create loan (or select existing)
   - Click "View Applications"
   - Find borrower's application
   - Click "Approve & Release Funds"
   - Wait for 2 transactions (STRK approval + approve_borrower)

5. **Verify on Borrower Side**:
   - **Wait 30 seconds** for auto-refresh OR
   - Refresh browser page manually
   - **Expected**: Loan #38 now appears in "⚠️ Your Active Loans" section
   - Shows:
     - 💰 Borrowed amount
     - 💸 Must Repay amount
     - 📈 Interest rate
     - ⏰ Countdown timer
     - 💸 Repay Now button

---

### Test Case 2: Page Reload After Approval

1. Borrower already has an approved loan (from Test Case 1)
2. Close browser tab
3. Open new tab: http://localhost:5173/borrower
4. Connect wallet
5. Generate ZK proof
6. **Expected**: Active loan appears immediately after ZK proof generation
   - **Before fix**: Would take 30 seconds (first auto-refresh)
   - **After fix**: Appears within 2-3 seconds

---

### Test Case 3: Multiple Active Loans

1. Borrower has 3 approved loans
2. All 3 should display in "Active Loans" section
3. Each with separate countdown timer
4. Clicking "Repay Now" on one should only affect that loan

---

## Debugging Console Logs

### When Loading Active Loans:

```javascript
// Frontend (LoanBorrowerFlowNew.jsx)
💼 Loading my active loans...
✅ My active loans: 1

// Backend (loanRoutes_onchain.js)
💼 Fetching active loans for borrower commitment: 0x22083c8b84ffd614c2...
✅ Found 1 active loans
```

### Expected Response:

```javascript
// Browser console
console.log(response.data);
// Output:
{
  loans: [
    {
      loanId: "38",
      amount: "1000000000000000000",
      interestRate: "500",
      approvedAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      repaymentDeadline: "2025-01-22T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  count: 1
}
```

---

## Files Changed

1. **backend/src/routes/loanRoutes_onchain.js** (line 795)
   - Changed: `res.json(activeLoans)` → `res.json({ loans: activeLoans, count: activeLoans.length })`

2. **frontend/src/pages/LoanBorrowerFlowNew.jsx** (line 357)
   - Added: `await loadMyActiveLoans();` after ZK proof generation

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Backend returns `{ loans: [...], count: N }` format
- [x] Frontend calls `loadMyActiveLoans()` after ZK proof
- [x] Frontend correctly accesses `response.data.loans`
- [x] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds includes active loans
- [x] Countdown timer displays for each active loan
- [x] Repay button triggers correct function
- [ ] **Manual test**: Approve loan → Wait 30s → Verify appears in borrower page
- [ ] **Manual test**: Refresh page → Verify active loan persists

---

## Additional Enhancements (Optional)

### Instant Update Without Waiting
Currently borrower must wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh. Could improve with:

1. **WebSocket/Polling**: Backend pushes notification when loan approved
2. **Blockchain Events**: Listen for `BorrowerApproved` event
3. **Manual Refresh Button**: Add "Refresh Active Loans" button

### Example WebSocket Implementation:
```javascript
// Backend: Emit event when loan approved
io.emit('loan_approved', { loanId, borrowerCommitment });

// Frontend: Listen for event
socket.on('loan_approved', (data) => {
  if (data.borrowerCommitment === zkProof.commitmentHash) {
    loadMyActiveLoans();
  }
});
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **30-second delay**: If borrower doesn't refresh page, takes 30s to see approved loan
2. **No real-time updates**: No push notifications when loan approved
3. **Cache dependency**: Relies on commitment cache being populated

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Test approval flow end-to-end
2. Verify active loans display correctly
3. Test repayment functionality
4. Test countdown timer updates
5. If working, commit changes:

```bash
git add backend/src/routes/loanRoutes_onchain.js
git add frontend/src/pages/LoanBorrowerFlowNew.jsx
git commit -m "fix: Active loans not appearing after approval

- Fixed backend response format (return { loans: [...] })
- Added loadMyActiveLoans() call after ZK proof generation
- Ensures approved loans immediately visible to borrower
- No more 30-second delay on page load

Fixes issue where approved loans vanished from borrower view"

git push origin fix/felt252-validation-and-slot-display
```

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Ready for testing  
**Impact**: High - Core functionality for loan lifecycle
