# ✅ Contracts Cleanup & Deployment Summary

## 🎯 What You Asked For

> "why i need to add my privated key, that will be fetched from the user right, and then remove the unwanted contracts from starknet folder and zk folder, and then i also want to run that contract in starknet and zk folder"

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Removed Private Key Requirement
**File:** `backend/.env`
```diff
- DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
+ # Note: No private keys needed in .env
+ # Transactions are signed by user's connected wallet (MetaMask, Argent X, Braavos)
```

**Why?** You were absolutely correct! In Web3, users connect their wallets (MetaMask, Argent X, or Braavos) and sign transactions directly. Private keys should NEVER be stored in code or .env files.

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Contracts

#### Deleted from `contracts/starknet/`:
- ❌ `payroll.cairo` - Web2 payroll verification (not needed)
- ❌ `verifier_stub.cairo` - Old verifier stub (not needed)

#### Deleted from `contracts/zk/`:
- ❌ `incomeVerifier.circom` - Web2 income verification (not needed)

#### What Remains (Essential Contracts):
```
contracts/
├── starknet/
│   └── loan_escrow.cairo ✅ (Updated with new features)
│
└── zk/
    ├── activityVerifier.circom ✅ (New circuit for wallet activity)
    └── README.md
```

---

### 3. Updated Essential Contracts

#### `loan_escrow.cairo` - Enhanced Features ✅

**New Capabilities:**
```cairo
struct Loan {
    borrower: felt,              // Real wallet (receives funds)
    ephemeral_address: felt,     // ⭐ Display wallet for privacy
    lender: felt,
    amount: felt,
    repayment_amount: felt,
    activity_threshold: felt,    // ⭐ Activity score (not income)
    proof_hash: felt,
    identity_cid: felt,          // IPFS encrypted identity
    state: felt,
    created_at: felt,
    funded_at: felt,
    repayment_deadline: felt,    // ⭐ Time-based deadline
    total_paid: felt,
    identity_revealed: felt      // ⭐ Only revealed on default
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `create_loan_request()` - Create loan with ephemeral address
- `fund_loan()` - Lender funds + sets deadline
- `make_payment()` - Borrower pays back
- `check_and_trigger_default()` - Anyone can trigger after deadline
- `get_identity()` - Only lender can access (after default)

---

#### `activityVerifier.circom` - New ZK Circuit ✅

**Proves:** `wallet_activity_score >= threshold`

**Privacy Preserved:**
- ✅ Exact score hidden
- ✅ Wallet address hidden
- ✅ Transaction history hidden

**What's Revealed:**
- ✅ "Meets requirement" (yes/no)
- ✅ Commitment hash (binds proof to wallet without revealing it)

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

```powershell
# Install Scarb (Cairo compiler)
irm https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.ps1 | iex

# Install Starkli (CLI deployment tool)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://get.starkli.sh -OutFile install.sh
wsl bash install.sh

# Install SnarkJS & Circom
npm install -g snarkjs
# Download Circom from: https://github.com/iden3/circom/releases
```

#### Step 2: Get Testnet Setup

1. **Install Wallet Extension**
   - [Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/)

2. **Get Testnet ETH**
   - Visit: https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/
   - Connect your wallet
   - Request 0.01 ETH (enough for deployment)

#### Step 3: Deploy Contracts

##### Deploy Starknet Contract

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd c:\zk-affordability-loan\contracts\starknet

# Compile Cairo contract
scarb build

# Deploy using Starkli
# Setup wallet first (one-time)
starkli signer keystore from-key ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
starkli account fetch <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> --output ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json

# Declare contract
starkli declare --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json target/dev/loan_escrow_loan_escrow.contract_class.json

# Deploy contract (replace <CLASS_HASH> with output from above)
starkli deploy --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json <CLASS_HASH>

# Save the CONTRACT_ADDRESS from output!
```

##### Build ZK Circuit

```bash
cd c:\zk-affordability-loan\contracts\zk

# Compile circuit
circom activityVerifier.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o build

# Setup (Powers of Tau)
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 pot12_0000.ptau -v
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot12_0000.ptau pot12_0001.ptau --name="First" -v
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot12_0001.ptau pot12_final.ptau -v

# Generate zkey
snarkjs groth16 setup build/activityVerifier.r1cs pot12_final.ptau activityVerifier_0000.zkey
snarkjs zkey contribute activityVerifier_0000.zkey activityVerifier_final.zkey --name="Circuit" -v
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey activityVerifier_final.zkey verification_key.json

# Copy to backend
cp build/activityVerifier_js/activityVerifier.wasm ../../backend/src/zk/
cp activityVerifier_final.zkey ../../backend/src/zk/
cp verification_key.json ../../backend/src/zk/
```

---

## 📝 After Deployment

### Update Environment Variables

**Backend (.env):**
```env
LOAN_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # Your deployed contract address
```

**Frontend (.env):**
```env
VITE_LOAN_ESCROW_ADDRESS=0x...  # Same contract address
```

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# View on Starkscan
https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Call contract via Starkli
starkli call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> get_loan 1
```

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before (Risky)
```
❌ Private key stored in .env file
❌ Auto-deployment with stored key
❌ Single point of failure
❌ If .env leaks = wallet compromised
```

### After (Secure)
```
✅ No private keys in code/config
✅ User connects wallet (Argent X/Braavos)
✅ Each transaction requires approval
✅ Hardware wallet support available
```

---

## 📊 Architecture Changes

### Old (Web2 Hybrid)
```
User → Bank API → Payroll Data → Income Proof → Loan
       ❌ Centralized
       ❌ Privacy issues  
       ❌ External dependencies
```

### New (Web3 Native)
```
User → Wallet Connection → On-chain Activity Analysis → 
       Activity Score → ZK Proof → Loan (Ephemeral Address)
       ✅ Decentralized
       ✅ Privacy-preserving
       ✅ Self-sovereign
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to add my private key anywhere?**
A: NO! That was the old way. Now you connect your wallet (Argent X or Braavos) and sign transactions in the wallet UI. Never store private keys in code.

**Q: Which contracts do I need to deploy?**
A: Only `loan_escrow.cairo` on Starknet. The ZK circuit (`activityVerifier.circom`) is built and used in the backend, not deployed as a contract.

**Q: How do I get testnet ETH?**
A: Visit https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/ with your Starknet wallet connected.

**Q: Can I deploy to mainnet?**
A: Yes, but only after thorough testing on testnet and a security audit. Real money = real risks!

**Q: What if deployment fails?**
A: Check the troubleshooting section in DEPLOYMENT.md. Common issues: insufficient balance, wrong network, compilation errors.
