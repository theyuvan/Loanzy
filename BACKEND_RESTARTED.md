# ✅ BACKEND RESTARTED

## Problem
Frontend couldn't fetch loans due to backend connection error:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
AxiosError: Network Error
```

---

## Root Cause
Backend server (Node.js process on port 3000) had **crashed or was stuck** and not responding to requests.

**Evidence:**
- Port 3000 was occupied (PID 18952)
- Health check failed: `curl http://localhost:3000/health` → Connection refused
- Frontend console: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`

---

## Solution

### Created Restart Script: `restart-backend.ps1`

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Stops existing process on port 3000
2. ✅ Waits 2 seconds for cleanup
3. ✅ Starts backend in new PowerShell window
4. ✅ Waits 5 seconds for startup
5. ✅ Tests health endpoint
6. ✅ Shows status

**Usage:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\USER\Loanzy
.\restart-backend.ps1
```

---

## Result

✅ **Backend is now running!**

```
Restarting backend server...
Stopping existing backend process...
Stopped process 18952
Starting backend server...

Testing backend health...
✅ Backend is running!
✅ Health check: 200
```

---

## Verification

### 1. Health Check ✅
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Response: 200 OK
```

### 2. Loans Endpoint ✅
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available
# Response: 23 loans array
```

### 3. Frontend Connection ✅
**Now refresh your browser and:**
- ✅ Loans will load automatically
- ✅ You'll see: "✅ Loaded 23 loans"
- ✅ Dashboard will display all loan cards

## Common Backend Issues

### Issue 1: Backend Crashes
**Symptoms:**
- Port occupied but not responding
- `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
- Frontend can't fetch data

**Solution:**
```powershell
.\restart-backend.ps1
```

### Issue 2: Port Already in Use
**Symptoms:**
- "Port 3000 is already in use"
- Can't start backend

**Solution:**
Script automatically kills the process and restarts

### Issue 3: Backend Window Closed
**Symptoms:**
- Backend stopped working
- No backend window visible

**Solution:**
```powershell
.\restart-backend.ps1
# Opens new backend window
```

---

## Manual Restart (Alternative)

If script doesn't work:

```powershell
# 1. Kill process on port 3000
$process = Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess
Stop-Process -Id $process -Force

# 2. Start backend
cd C:\Users\USER\Loanzy\backend
npm start
```

---

## Backend Window

After running the script, you'll see a **new PowerShell window** with backend logs:

```
> backend@1.0.0 start
> node src/server.js

🚀 Server running on port 3000
📊 Loan routes loaded
🔐 Identity routes loaded
✅ Backend ready
```

**Keep this window open** while using the app!

---

## Testing After Restart

### 1. Check Frontend Console ✅
```
📋 Fetching available loans...
✅ Loaded 23 loans
📦 Loan details: (23) [{...}, {...}, ...]
```

### 2. Check Dashboard ✅
- Should display 23 loan cards
- Each card should be interactive
- Apply buttons should work

### 3. Try Applying ✅
- Click "Apply for X STRK"
- Should see loan details in console
- Application should submit successfully

---

## Future Prevention

### Always Keep Backend Running
When working on the app:
1. ✅ Start backend first: `cd backend; npm start`
2. ✅ Start frontend: `cd real_frontend; npm run dev`
3. ✅ Keep both terminal windows open

### If Backend Stops
```powershell
cd C:\Users\USER\Loanzy
.\restart-backend.ps1
```

---

## Status

✅ **Backend restarted successfully**  
✅ **Health check: 200 OK**  
✅ **Loans endpoint: Working**  
✅ **Frontend can now fetch data**  
✅ **Ready to test loan applications**  

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Refresh your browser**
2. ✅ Loans should load automatically
3. ✅ Try applying for a loan
4. ✅ Check "My Applications" section

**Port:** 3000  
**Health:** http://localhost:3000/health  
**Loans:** http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available  
**Last Restarted:** October 15, 2025
