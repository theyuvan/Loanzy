# ✅ BACKEND FIXED - NOW TEST THE FRONTEND!

## Problem Was: Backend RPC Connection Failed

**Fixed:** Backend now connects to StarkNet Sepolia correctly!

---

## Status Update

### ✅ **Backend (Port 3000)**
- Running with correct RPC URL
- Network: Sepolia
- Connected to blockchain successfully
- Can query loans from blockchain

### ✅ **Frontend (Port 3001)**  
- Already configured to fetch from backend
- Uses `loanApi.getAvailableLoans()` which calls backend

---

## What to Test NOW

### **1. Refresh Your Lender Page**

Go to: http://localhost:3001/lenders

Click **"Connect Wallet"**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Wallet connects successfully
- ✅ NO MORE 500 errors in console!
- ✅ Stats should load (even if 0)
- ✅ "My Loans" section should appear

---

### **2. Your Loans Should Appear!**

You created 2 loans:
1. TX: `0x184ae834dde97f6e7095db8a5cee0b18d98545e9f1c10d4652a22c845672ff5`
2. TX: `0xe1674f7a3c9624283fd2012273b5088852a129d1df75edb38213f6c8211a59`

These should now show in the "My Loans" section!

**Each loan should display:**
- Amount per borrower
- Total slots / Filled slots
- Interest rate
- Repayment period
- Min activity score
- Status: Active

---

### **3. Test Full Flow**

#### **As Lender:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/lenders
2. Connect wallet
3. See your 2 loans in "My Loans"
4. Create a new loan to test
5. After 2 seconds, it should auto-refresh and show the new loan

#### **As Borrower:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/borrowers
2. Connect wallet
3. Should see all 3 available loans
4. Apply for one!

## How It Works Now

### **Frontend → Backend → Blockchain**

```
Real Frontend (localhost:3001)
    ↓
API Call: GET /api/loan/available
    ↓
Backend (localhost:3000)
    ↓
StarkNet RPC (Sepolia)
    ↓
Loan Escrow Contract
    ↓
Returns loan data
    ↓
Backend formats it
    ↓
Frontend displays it
```

---

## Expected Console Output

### **Frontend Console (Browser):**
```
✅ STRK Balance: 149.9947766399712 STRK
📊 Fetching available loans...
✅ Found 3 loans
```

### **Backend Console (Terminal):**
```
info: GET /api/loan/available
info: 📋 Fetching available loans from blockchain
info: 📊 Total loans on blockchain: 3
✅ Found 3 available loans
```

---

## If You Still See Errors

### **Error: "Failed to fetch loans"**
**Solution:** Wait 10 seconds for backend to fully start, then refresh

### **Error: "No loans showing"**
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend terminal - should say "✅ Found X available loans"
2. Wait 30 seconds for blockchain indexing
3. Click "Refresh" button

### **Error: "500 Internal Server Error"**
**Solution:** Backend might have crashed, restart it:
```powershell
cd backend
npm start
```

---

## Backend API Endpoints Working

Now that RPC is fixed, these endpoints work:

- ✅ `GET /api/loan/available` - Get all available loans
- ✅ `GET /api/loan/lender/:address` - Get loans by lender
- ✅ `GET /api/loan/:loanId/applications` - Get applications for a loan
- ✅ All blockchain queries working!

---

## Test Results

### **Before Fix:**
```
❌ GET http://localhost:3000/api/loan/available 500 (Internal Server Error)
error: ❌ Error fetching loans: fetch failed
```

### **After Fix:**
```
✅ info: 📋 Fetching available loans from blockchain
✅ info: 📊 Total loans on blockchain: 3
✅ info: ✅ Found 3 available loans
```

---

## What Changed in Real Frontend

**Nothing!** The real frontend was already correctly implemented. It was just waiting for the backend to work properly.

The frontend code already:
- ✅ Fetches from backend API
- ✅ Formats loan data correctly
- ✅ Displays in beautiful UI
- ✅ Auto-refreshes after creating loans

All we needed was to **fix the backend RPC connection**!
